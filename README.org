This project exists because it's difficult to accurately measure a modern computer's audio-visual system's latency.
Generating video and audio output is easy enough, but modern operating systems introduce *variable* amounts of latency due to a variety of other factors (multitasking, context switches, kernel vs. user code, etc).  This causes the latency between its different outputs (i.e. audio and video) to appear to be non-deterministic[1].  This means that for someone running an experiment needing sub-millisecond timing resolution, simply relying on the computer's scheduling is not enough.

Therefore we hope to solve this by removing one source of latency from the equation.

In the original experiment designed by Ben Motz, a Matlab program (using Psych Toolbox) generates audio tones and video frames in a specific ordering.  The operating system (Mac OS X 10.x) introduces a variable latency between the beginning of the video frame and its respective audio tone.

We eliminate this variable latency through the addition of special-purpose hardware.  A photodiode mounted on the screen feeds a microcontroller, which in turn plays a preset audio waveform.

In this experiment there are 2 different tones (white and pink noise), and for maximum flexibility we trigger these tones separately using 2 photodiode inputs.

[1]: In reality, this non-deterministic appearance is only from the perspective of "user mode" code, which is what experimenters generally use.


** Actual Latency
- The delay between one of the input pushbuttons and the digital output of the device is 800 microseconds.
- The delay between one of the input pushbuttons and audio tone playback is 34.8 milliseconds.

In order to generate simultaneous audio and video stimuli, your video monitor should generate its audio trigger in frame =x=, and then generate the visual stimuli in frame =x+2=.

** Features

- 2 photodiode inputs (with manual momentary switch for testing/override)
- stereo (actually dual-mono) 1/8" headphone output capable of driving 8 ohm headphones
- 2 noise tones - "white" and "pink"
- volume adjustable in 5dB steps
- wall powered (not dependent on USB)
- usb jack for power (and programming)

The noise tones have the same envelope:

- 3ms linear ramp-up
- 10.7ms at 100%
- 3ms linear ramp-down
